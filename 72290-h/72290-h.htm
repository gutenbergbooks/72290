<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Pneumatic Conveying has recently attracted great
and widespread interest amongst engineers and
others interested in the economical handling of
materials. The information hitherto available on
the subject has, however, been so meagre and so
indefinite that the author offers this concise
treatment of principles, methods and applications
in order that those who are anxious to avail themselves
of this flexible means of transportation may
know just how, and why, it is worthy of their
attention.</p>

<p>The high cost of labour, coupled with the desire
to improve the condition of the worker who has
had to work in a dust-laden atmosphere of an
objectionable, or even poisonous nature, will create
such a demand for pneumatic conveying plant
that present day methods of transportation will
be revolutionized in many branches of industry.</p>

<p>The author has had three years’ experience with
one of the first pneumatic plants erected in this
country, for use with coal, ashes, and flue dust,
and he has conducted numerous experiments on
other materials, such as sand, oxide, potatoes,
various chemicals, etc., and has endeavoured to
add his quota to the information available for the
benefit of other engineers and works managers.</p>

<p>Experiments proved that with certain materials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
the discharger was the weak link in the chain,
as wet sticky materials entering at a high velocity
“packed” tight and would not discharge freely.
This led to experiments which, with the valuable
assistance of Mr. H. B. Clarke, A.M.I.E.E., resulted
in overcoming this difficulty by means which are
described fully in Chapter VI.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to go fully into the
questions of domestic vacuum cleaners, removing
dust from manufacturing processes, etc. The
chief aim has been rather to bring into prominence
the flexibility and other advantages of moving
air as a means of conveying and elevating heavy
solid materials which hitherto it has been thought
could not be handled in this manner.</p>

<p>The author gladly acknowledges the interest
and information given by the following firms and
individuals Mr. H. B. Clarke, A.M.I.E.E.;

<span class="fs80">SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS OF PNEUMATIC
CONVEYING</span></h2>

<p class="no-indent">Conveying by mechanical means has existed for
many centuries, and is one of the earliest forms of
man’s ingenuity towards labour saving as we know
it to-day. The pneumatic conveyance of materials
from one position to another, either horizontally
or vertically, is the most recent form of automatic
handling of solid substances.</p>

<p><b>Genesis and Applications of Pneumatic Conveying.</b>
The need of water for human consumption and
for irrigation purposes caused the ancient inventor
to carry out nearly all his experiments with that
substance, and the first instance we have of anything
approaching pneumatic conveying is the
well known injector in which steam is passed
through one pipe, placed at right angles to a second
pipe, at such a velocity as to reduce the pressure
in the second pipe to below the atmospheric
pressure. The excess of atmospheric pressure over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the reduced pressure in the second pipe then drives
up the latter the material (in this case water) in
which the end of the pipe is submerged. This
invention is about a century old, if it emanated
from the Marquis Mammonry d’Eclet, in 1818,
as is usually believed.</p>

<p>The first practical application of this invention
to other than liquid materials is supposed to have
been in connection with the conveying of cotton
in a loose form, as an improvement upon the
manual shifting of large bales. This development
was made about 1867, and after this date
great progress was made, principally in connection
with the handling of grain, wheat, malt, etc., and
largely owing to the work of an American named
A. K. Williams.</p>

<p>At the present day it is hardly possible to
enumerate all the successful schemes for the pneumatic
handling of materials. In addition to
installations for the conveyance of materials such
as those mentioned above is the pneumatic tube,
for conveying papers, messages and cash in offices
and between shop counter and cash desk, etc.
Also, there is the suction cleaner, ranging in application
from the handling of refuse and dust from
saw mills and woodworking machinery to the
removal of fine abrasive and poisonous particles
in certain manufacturing processes. Small suction
cleaners are, of course, now quite familiar domestic
appliances. The sand-blasting machine is really
another example of a self contained pneumatic
conveyor on a small scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Ashes, coal, oranges, sugar, chemicals, spent
oxide, iron ore, spent tanning bark, and many
other materials are now actually transported,
elevated or conveyed pneumatically, and it must
here be acknowledged that the first really successful
plant in this country was due entirely to the
initiative and inventive genius of Mr. Frederic
Eliot Duckham, late Chief Engineer to the Millwall
Dock Co., who in 1888 commenced experiments
in grain-handling by suction. In 1892 he produced
a very successful floating plant for unloading ships
into land silos, and this installation was the
prototype of many similar plants which were placed
in commission all over the world. Many improvements
have been carried out and numerous patents
issued for pneumatic handling apparatus, but the
original scheme as designed by Mr. Duckham has
never been departed from seriously.</p>


<p><b>Fundamental Principles and Components.</b> The
pneumatic conveyance of materials along pipes is
most easily understood when the equipment is
considered as a pump producing a high velocity
stream of air in which the material to be transported
is floating, and with which it is carried
through the pipe system. It is necessary fully to
understand this, as it is otherwise difficult to
realize how it can be possible to lift solids at the
rate of 100 tons or more per hour, several hundred
feet up a pipe in which the vacuum does not
exceed about 7 inches mercury column (say,
11 lb. per sq. in. absolute).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>A modern pneumatic conveying plant of the
<em>suction type</em> comprises: (1) An <em>exhauster</em>, or an air
pump, of either the reciprocating or the rotary
type. (2) A <em>suction nozzle</em>. (3) A <em>discharger</em>,
whereby the material is extracted from the pipe
line at the desired position, without “breaking”
or losing the vacuum. (4) One or more appliances
for <em>filtering</em> the air and extracting any foreign
material which may have been carried over from
the discharger and which would damage the
cylinder walls of the exhauster if allowed to enter
the plant.</p>

<p>It is necessary here to mention that all pneumatic
conveying is not done by exhausting, but
frequently by the use of <em>pressure</em>, that is, that the
air is not sucked along the transport line but is
actually blown in under pressure by fans, air
compressors, or rotary blowers, according to the
circumstances.</p>

<p>The <em>suction system</em> is preferable when it is
required to convey materials from several outlying
points to one central storage bunker or area. On
the other hand, the <em>pressure system</em> is less expensive
in first cost, when it is required to transport from
one central point to numerous outlying plants
in the area to be served. A combination of the
suction and pressure systems is now being developed
for the handling of materials in cases
where neither the “suction” nor the “blowing”
scheme alone can be said to be successful. This
combined system is known as the <em>induction system</em>
and is discussed in Chapter VI.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>


<p><b>Advantages over Mechanical Conveyors.</b> The
reasons why pneumatic methods for elevating and
conveying are now receiving such attention are to
be found in the advantages of pneumatic over
mechanical conveying. These may be summarized
as follows: Economy in labour; flexibility of
plant both in design and operation; elimination
of dust and its harmful effects on the employees;
and in many instances the recovery of dust which
is valuable and which would otherwise represent
a serious financial loss. Wear and tear on moving
parts is reduced to a minimum. All obstacles
such as buildings, roads, rivers, railways, etc., can
be overcome easily since the conveyor is “only a
pipe.” Should circumstances not permit of a
straight single run for such appliances as bucket
elevators, it is usually necessary to bag and cart
the material from one position to another, but
this is avoided by pneumatic elevating and conveying,
because the pipe can be carried up or down,
round corners, over or under roads, etc.</p>

<p>Hundreds of instances still exist in which loose
material in barges is shovelled into bags, which
are lifted by an ordinary friction hoist into a
building over the quay-side. The sacks are wheeled
by manual labour into the building, and emptied
into hoppers or silos, the empty bags being lowered
again for a further cycle of operations. This
costly multiple handling may be obviated by the
erection of a small pipe line which will automatically
feed itself at one end, and discharge
evenly and continuously into the receptacle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
provided. The whole of the “moving parts”
may be situated in one position, which enables
them to be carefully inspected, oiled and kept in
repair, etc.</p>

<p>Cranes, hoists, telphers, and belt conveyors all
have their special spheres of usefulness, but no
other plant can claim all the advantages of the
pneumatic system as outlined above.</p>


<p><b>Pneumatic Conveying Systems.</b> As mentioned
above there are three main systems of pneumatic
conveying, viz.—</p>

<p>(1) Conveying by air <em>above</em> atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>(2) Conveying by air <em>below</em> atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>(3) Conveying by air <em>above and below</em> atmospheric
pressure, by a combination of (1) and (2),
known as the <em>induction</em> system.</p>

<p>Although these are the main headings under
which the subject may be considered, they must
be sub-divided further as follows—</p>


<p><b>(1) Conveying above Atmospheric Pressure.</b> (<em>a</em>)
<em>Low pressure systems</em> using single-stage centrifugal
fans, and suitable for conveying such materials as
wool, cotton, bark, chopped straw, paper clippings,
sawdust, shavings, jute, and fibrous materials of
many kinds.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>High pressure systems</em> using multi-stage fans
and blowers of the rotary type or positive design,
and suitable for conveying materials of a denser
nature such as dry sand, sugar, etc., also for
pneumatic despatch tubes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>


<p>(<b>2</b>) <b>Air Suction Systems.</b> (<em>a</em>) <em>Large pipe systems</em>
using ordinary steel plate centrifugal fans, and
applied to handling the waste products and
injurious dust in many industries, such materials
being sawdust and shavings from woodworking
machinery; emery dust from grinding wheels;
dust and lint from polishing mops; leather dust
from heel and sole scouring plants; starch dust
in confectionery works; colour dust in works
manufacturing pigments; and bronze dust in
printing works. Many other examples will no
doubt occur to the reader.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Small pipe systems</em> using multi-stage centrifugal
fans or rotary blowers. Under this section
the most important plants are undoubtedly those
for domestic vacuum cleaning. Large stationary
plants for this purpose are installed in many
hotels, offices, buildings, workshops, theatres, large
private houses, etc.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Heavy commercial systems</em> in which the fan is
replaced by a reciprocating exhauster, producing
currents of air suitable for conveying such materials
as coal, ashes, sugar, leather tanning bark, ores,
granite chippings, wood blocks, oranges, etc.,
which it would be impossible, or undesirable, to
pass through a fan.</p>


<p>(<b>3</b>) <b>Induction System.</b> A compressed air injector
is used to produce a partial vacuum on the suction
or inlet end of the pipe system, and to produce
a pressure above atmospheric at the delivery end,
thus avoiding the necessity for a discharger. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
system, which is suitable for use with heavy sticky
materials—such as hot sugar, saturated sand,
finely ground heavy ores, spent oxide as used in
gas works, etc.—is now being developed so as to
make possible pneumatic conveyance of all manner
of materials which are unsuitable for passing
through the discharger, or air lock, of a suction
system.</p>


<p><b>Factors influencing Design.</b> In the strict sense
of the term, “pneumatic conveying” really implies
the conveyance of a quantity of material from
one point to another, using air as the conveying
agent. As will be seen from the above, the
subject also embraces the removal of comparatively
light dust produced in many industrial
processes. Although the same name is implied
in both cases, the methods to be adopted vary,
and each case must be considered on its own
merits.</p>

<p>With regard to a conveying plant proper, the
points for consideration in the initial stages are
as follows—</p>

<p>(1) The nature of the material to be handled and
the quantity required in a given time.</p>

<p>(2) The size of the largest and smallest pieces
of materials and the density of the material.</p>

<p>(3) The distance over which the material is to
be conveyed.</p>

<p>(4) The difference in level between the point at
which the material is fed into the system, and the
point where it is delivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>(5) The method and regularity of feeding the
material into the system.</p>

<p>(6) The means to be adopted for separating the
material from the conveying air at the desired
point of delivery.</p>

<p>There is a very important distinction between
plants in which the material passes <em>through</em> the
fan or blower and those in which the conveying
is carried out entirely under suction.</p>

<p>The latter system has many advantages, but it
carries with it the necessity of providing automatic
delivery of the material without seriously impairing
the suction. In order to accomplish this, some
form of “air lock” is required, and a necessary
feature of this is a device with close-fitting surfaces
or more or less air-tight valves. The simpler plan
is undoubtedly to pass the material through the
fan, as there is then no question of breaking the
suction in order to get the material out of the
system. It is common practice to convey for long
distances such materials as wood chippings and
sawdust, cotton, jute, wool, esparto grass, paper
chippings and many other materials. In all cases,
however, the designer is confronted with the
problem of separating the material from the air,
and in many instances to do this satisfactorily is
more difficult than the actual conveying; especially
is this so with certain sticky materials or materials
which will readily “pack” or build up when
entering any mechanical discharger at the high
velocity necessary in the suction system.</p>

<span class="fs80">DETAILS OF PLANT
PUMPS, EXHAUSTERS AND AIR FILTERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">A pneumatic conveying plant of practically any
type comprises the following five main components:
(1) A <em>pump</em> or <em>exhauster</em> to create a partial vacuum
in the pipe line and so induce a high velocity air
current in which the material will be conveyed.
(2) An <em>air filter</em> in which any light dust carried
over beyond the receiver is trapped, to prevent
its entering the exhauster where it would quickly
damage the piston rings and cylinder walls of
reciprocating pumps. (3) A main <em>receiver</em> or <em>discharger</em>,
and occasionally one or more subsidiary
receivers, in which the conveyed material is
extracted from the system and discharged into
the receptacle or on to a dump as required.
(4) The <em>pipe line</em>, <em>junctions</em>, etc., to connect the
point of supply with the desired point of delivery.
(5) The <em>suction nozzle</em> through which the material
enters the system, together with the “free air”
which is to act as the conveying medium.</p>


<p><b>Pumps and Exhausters.</b> The type of apparatus
used for creating the flow of air varies according to
the ideas of the numerous makers of the plants.
It must be remembered that for a pump working
under the conditions required for pneumatic plants
it is not a high vacuum that is required; the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
important function is to handle very large
quantities of air at a comparatively low vacuum.</p>

<p>The most efficient type of plant for dealing with
large quantities of air is certainly the reciprocating
pump, although several makers are now devoting
a lot of attention to the multi-stage turbine type
of blower, or exhauster. The probability is that
this type may shortly be as efficient as the reciprocating
pump, and if so it is almost sure to be
used extensively, as it has distinct advantages in
other directions compared with the cylinder and
piston type. This remark has special reference
to the high pressure system for conveying sand,
coal, sugar, etc., and does not apply to the “small
pipe system” detailed later.</p>

<p>In dealing with ashes, flue dust, crushed iron ore,
and similar abrasive materials, it is essential that
the air passing through the pump should be
filtered thoroughly so that no dust should enter
the cylinders and cut the walls and piston rings.
The turbo-blower, having no rubbing surfaces,
would suffer little or no damage from a small
percentage of dust, hence the filtering equipment
might be less elaborate and less costly. No
lubrication would be necessary in the rotary pump
(except, of course, at the bearings), hence no
difficulties would arise owing to oil acting as a dust
trap, as is sometimes the case in reciprocating
pumps with defective air filters.</p>

</div>
<br>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
<p><b>Typical Reciprocating Pump.</b> Fig. 1 shows the
general construction of a vertical steam-driven air
pump such as is generally used in present day
plants. The pump shown has a stroke of 14 ins.,
with an air-cylinder diameter of 28 ins. The
machine is a dry air pump, and is fitted with
Corliss inlet valves and special leather exhaust
valves: it is fitted with ring-oiling bearings and
automatic continuous lubrication, and under test
it shows a mechanical efficiency of 78 per cent.
from power input to air horse-power delivered.
Such a pump is suitable for a plant handling
20 to 25 tons per hour and, if preferred, the
pump may be driven through gearing from an
electric motor on the same bed-plate.</p>


<p><b>Rotary Blowers and Exhausters.</b> The turbine
blower and exhauster depend entirely upon centrifugal
force for their power to compress or
exhaust air or gas, etc. The use of centrifugal
force makes this type of machine resemble the
centrifugal water-pump, but radical differences in
design have to be introduced, seeing that water
is not compressible, whereas air is capable of compression,
and alterations are also necessary, due to
the great difference in specific gravity of the two
substances.</p>

<p>Owing to the very low specific gravity of air,
the machine must run at a much higher speed than
would be required with water to develop a given
pressure. The high speed of the steam turbine
has given impetus to the design of large exhausters
on the turbine principle.</p>

<p>It will be recognized that, when air is made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
flow steadily along a conduit or pipe of gradually
diminishing cross-sectional area, the velocity of
the air must increase correspondingly, in order
that the constant quantity may flow through the
smaller section of pipe. Increasing the velocity
will diminish the pressure due to the greater
kinetic energy to increase the velocity. The
converse is the result of passing air at
constant pressure through a channel gradually
increasing from a smaller to a larger area, the
velocity being then reduced and the pressure
increased.</p>

<p>Now if a number of impellers be mounted turbine
fashion on a high speed shaft, and the casing be so
designed that the area between stages gradually
increases, the air will enter the first stage and will
be caught up by the impeller and accelerated until
it leaves No. 1 impeller at a higher pressure and
velocity. Leaving the casing through a diffuser
which gradually increases in area the velocity is
transformed into pressure in the diffuser. The
air therefore travels to the second stage with
its initial pressure plus the pressure due
to the conversion of velocity in the first
diffuser. This process may be repeated stage
by stage until almost any desired pressure is
obtained.</p>

<p>As there are no rubbing surfaces in this type of
machine it is particularly suitable for the work
under consideration, and when developed for
efficient running in small sizes it will be very
effective in “booming” pneumatic conveying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>


<p><b>Sturtevant Blower or Exhauster.</b> The Sturtevant
Engineering Co., Ltd., has developed a special
rotary blower or exhauster suitable for use with
pneumatic conveying installations and, although
this machine has not a water-seal for surfaces
under pressure (as in the Nash Hydro-Turbo
described below), it has a number of distinctive
points, and the discharge of the air, or the intake
of air, as the case may be, occurs at a more nearly
constant pressure and with smaller pulsations than
with any other rotary blower known to the writer.</p>

<p>The sectional diagrams (Fig. <a href="#i_p017">2</a>) show the four
successive stages in the movement of the rotors.
In position (1), chamber <em>D</em> has been filled with air,
while chamber <em>E</em> is discharging air against pressure
in the delivery pipe. In position (2), chamber <em>D</em>
is cut off from the inlet, and the air in it is being
carried round. Blade <em>C</em> has entered pocket <em>Z</em>,
which is filled with air under pressure; this air,
however, in turn is released into pocket <em>Y</em> through
leakage passage <em>O</em>. Continued rotation carries the
rotors <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> to position (3), and the remaining
pressure in <em>Z</em> is now being transferred to <em>X</em>
by leakage passage <em>N</em>.</p>

<p>As the fourth position is reached, chamber <em>F</em> is
filling and pocket <em>Y</em> is discharging its air. When
further rotation brings impeller blade <em>B</em> into the
discharge passage, the air in space <em>D</em> will be
delivered from the blower. After leaving position
(4), the rotors again reach a position similar to
that shown at (1), and the cycle is then repeated.</p>

<br>

<p>A study of the above will convince the reader
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>that this blower is ingenious and very suitable for
the class of work under investigation.</p>

<p>For certain conditions the Roots blower and the
multifarious types of drum pumps or blowers can
be used, seeing that it is quantity rather than
pressure that is required, but it is essential that
the most reliable and efficient exhauster should
be installed in accordance with the conditions for
each installation, bearing in mind always the
questions of dust, speed, lubrication, etc.</p>


<p><b>Nash Hydro-Turbine.</b> An entirely new type of
rotary exhauster was recently illustrated in the
<cite>Chemical Age</cite>, and a study of Fig. 3 will show the
principle of this pump. This pump was built just
before the war by Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert, and
similar pumps are now being introduced by the
Nash Engineering Co. (U.S.A.), and are known as
the Nash Hydro-Turbine.</p>

<p>This exhauster has a cylindroid external casing,
inside which is a shaft carried on the two end
brackets and having mounted upon it a crude type
of water-wheel. It should be noted here that this
arrangement has the effect of bringing the edges
of the wheel into a position of eccentricity in
relation to the inside of the external casing.</p>

<p>The wheel shaft is connected directly to a high
speed electric motor, and when the pump is running
the water which is fed into the casing is thrown by
centrifugal force to the periphery of the casing and
thus forms certain air pockets into which the air
of the system is drawn. The air is now locked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
between the hub of the wheel and the sheet of
water surrounding the outside of the wheel. As
the wheel revolves, the air in each pocket in turn
is compressed into a smaller capacity and eventually,
when it arrives opposite the outlet point,
it at once escapes into the atmosphere due to its
additional pressure.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p019" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p019.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.—Nash “Hydro-Turbo” Exhauster.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Tracing the wheel right round we then find that
another pocket is formed into which the air is
again sucked, and so the cycle of operations
continues, two compressions and extractions
occurring per revolution of the spindle. For many
materials such a pump has the great advantage
that the water acts as a wet filter and traps all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
the dust in suspension which can be washed out in
the form of sludge. Where the dust is valuable
this characteristic would be a disadvantage, but
it is very useful in plants dealing with corrosive
and abrasive materials.</p>


<p><b>Lubrication.</b> The lubrication of cylinders in the
reciprocating type of pump has been mentioned in
connection with the necessity for taking special
care in filtering <em>all</em> dust from the air pulled over
from the discharger. Ordinary oil makes a sticky
surface to which any dust adheres readily, and the
two combined make an abrasive mixture which
will quickly score and damage the walls of the
cylinders. One firm, at least, has gone a long way
towards removing this trouble by inserting pieces
of solid graphite into the piston: this provides
dry lubrication and produces a very smooth surface
on which dust finds great difficulty in obtaining
a “footing.”</p>

<p>The use of “Aquadag” is also fairly successful:
this lubricant consists of deflocculated graphite in
such very fine particles that they will remain in
suspension in water even without mechanical
agitation. “Aquadag” is fed into the cylinders
in the same way as oil and deposits its graphite
in the pores of the cylinder walls, whilst the water
is atomized and blown out with the air.</p>

<p>The turbine exhauster solves the problem by
eliminating the necessity for internal lubrication,
and the perfect filtering of the air is then not so
important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>


<p><b>Air Filters.</b> It is impossible to deal with practically
any granular material without carrying
over more or less dust beyond the discharger,
and to obviate the damage and inconvenience
which would result from allowing this to enter the
exhauster, an air filter is fitted between the discharger
and the pump. Many types of air filters
have been introduced, and representative examples
are described below.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p021" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p021.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.—Sturtevant “Cyclone” Dust
Separator.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>“Cyclone” Separators.</b> For such materials as
grain, malt, etc., the ordinary type of cyclone
separator is frequently mounted inside the receiver.
This separator consists of an inverted cone: the
dust laden air enters at the top and the heavy
material circulates inside, and gradually falls to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the bottom from which it is discharged into
suitable containers (see Fig. <a href="#i_p021">4</a>).</p>

<p>The cyclone is an excellent separator, and has
the advantage that it is self-cleaning, and offers
little or no resistance to the flow of air, but so
large a cone would be required to separate very
fine dusts that it frequently becomes impossible
to use this type of plant.</p>


<p><b>Bag Filters.</b> An alternative type of air filter is
the ordinary bag filter, which consists of a number
of closely woven fabric “stockings” in a cast
iron container. The air is led into the casing so
that it passes down through the inside of the tubes,
through the fabric, where it deposits the greater
proportion of the dust, and then out to the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Naturally, after working a certain period, the
fabric becomes choked with deposited dust, and
it is then necessary to dislodge the dust by shaking
the “stocking” somewhat violently. This is
usually carried out by a mechanically operated
vibrating apparatus, but cleaning is done more
effectively and time is saved if the air is shut off
from the filter while the dust is dislodged. This
is done most conveniently by having two similar
filters installed, working in parallel; then, when
cleaning becomes necessary, all the air is passed
through each filter in turn, whilst the other is
cleaned.</p>

<p>The bags or tubes hang vertically in the casing,
and as the air is brought in at the top and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
discharged in a downward vertical direction, it
naturally discharges the heavier material straight
into the bottom of the casing, owing to the inertia
of the heavy particles and the high velocity of the
incoming air.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Fig. 5 illustrates a Sturtevant automatic bag
filter. In this case the air is brought in at the
bottom. The cleaning of the bags is effected automatically.
At frequent intervals and in rotation,
each section of bags is cut off automatically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
from the supply of dust-laden air by closing the
outlet valve of that section. At the same time,
that section is opened to the atmosphere at the top,
causing a reverse current of air downwards. The
bags are then agitated automatically and the dust
adhering to the fabric drops, and is blown into the
discharge hopper below. The opening and closing
of the valves is accomplished by a simple mechanism
driven by the pulley shown at the top of the
illustration. Where the amount of dust to be
handled is large and continuous it can be extracted
from the hopper by a worm or screw conveyor, or,
as in some other patterns, by a rotary valve placed
in the bottom of the hopper.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p><b>Mollers’ Air Filter.</b> This apparatus consists of
separate fabric pockets mounted on a frame. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
pockets are rectangular and taper towards the top.
Referring to Fig. 6, <em>A</em> is the frame on which the
fabric is stretched, and <em>B</em> is the fabric pocket.
As many of these units as necessary are mounted
side by side in an adjustable frame, each unit
having fixing and tension bolts. This arrangement
permits a filter of any desired capacity to be built
up quickly, and facilitates repairs and cleaning
of filter bags.</p>


<p><b>Wet Filters.</b> The type of filtering apparatus used
for dealing with poisonous material, emery dust
from grinding wheels, sand from sand-blasting
apparatus, etc., is usually of the wet type, of which
Fig. 7 is a good example. This apparatus consists
of a tank having a wire shelf on which a layer of
coke is supported. The tank is partially filled
with water, the level of which is regulated by an
overflow.</p>

<p>The dust-laden air impinges on the surface of
the water, and the major portion of the dust is
trapped by being driven actually into the water.
The dust particles too light to be brought into
contact with the water are compelled to pass
through the coke screen and are there arrested.
If necessary, the scheme can be made to deal with
finer dusts by having the coke constantly sprayed
with water. The dust is reclaimed from the tank in
the form of sludge or mud through the door or
valve provided for that purpose.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Another type of air filter which might be developed
in connection with the pneumatic handling of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
material consists of a very slowly revolving drum
or cylinder, which is fitted with a continuous
corrugated tape running spirally from the centre
to the extreme edge of the casing. The space
between the corrugated sheets is very small, and
as a stream of water is continually running over
and around the divisions, the air passing through
the very tortuous path provided is bound to
come into contact with these wet surfaces and
give up its dust or other contamination, which is
washed off when it arrives at the bottom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
cylinder. Naturally, this or any other wet filter
would not be used where the recovery of dust in
dry form was desired.</p>

<p>Another form of wet filter consists of a chamber
of suitable proportions (according to the amount
of air to be cleansed), fitted with racks in which are
placed strips of glass at an angle of 45° to the flow
of air, and at 90° to one another. The glass
strips have a serrated or prismatic face, and the
air carries the dust forward into the angles of the
glass. A very fine water spray keeps the glass
moist and eventually trickles down to the drain
channels, washing the glass in its course.</p>

<p>The development of apparatus for <em>air-washing</em>
has received considerable attention during recent
years, owing to the necessity of having pure,
dust-free air for ventilating turbo-generators, etc.,
and no difficulty should present itself in obtaining
satisfactory results for pneumatic conveying plants,
except in cases when the collection and retention
of dust is required. In these cases the bag or
fabric sheet filter is the only type available.</p>

<span class="fs80"><span class="allsmcap">DETAILS OF PLANT</span>—(<em>Contd.</em>)<br>
DISCHARGERS, PIPE LINES AND SUCTION NOZZLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><b>Dischargers.</b> The advocates of “blowing”
material, instead of “sucking” it through the
pipe, often lay great stress on the alleged difficulties
of extracting the material from the system
without allowing air leakage. This, however, has
been overcome successfully by several designers
and is not the serious difficulty so frequently
suggested, providing that the material is suitable
for this means of treatment. The only exception
to this is, when the high velocity at which the
material enters the discharger—say, 45 to 50 ft.
per sec.—causes it to pack or bind so that it will
not fall by gravity into the rotary valves and then
out into the storage bins.</p>

<p>The function of the discharger is to cause the
incoming material to lose its velocity and to fall
into a compartment which can eventually be
discharged after it has been moved from the low
pressure to which the chamber itself is subjected.</p>

<p>This is best accomplished by the use of a rotary
valve, somewhat similar to a paddle-wheel, which
is revolved slowly but continuously. This wheel
can be placed either vertically or horizontally at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the bottom of the receiving chamber; the material
enters the large chamber above, loses its velocity,
drops by gravity, is caught in the box formed by
the revolving paddle-wheel, and gradually is
carried forward out of the chamber, eventually
passing over an aperture through which it again
gravitates to the bunker, silo, or other container.
Probably the horizontal type of rotary valve is
preferable because, owing to the increased surface
exposed to the vacuum, the “suction” effect
assists in holding the valve up to its seat.</p>

<p>When dealing with such materials as malt and
grain, it is an advantage to be able to inspect the
material entering the receiver, and at least one
maker secures this advantage by constructing the
chamber of a glass cylinder to which are bolted
cast iron top and bottom pieces carrying the
necessary pipe connections and discharge valves.
Fig. 8 illustrates this construction and also shows
fairly clearly the method of driving or revolving
the discharge valves. The top flange of the valve
has a worm wheel tooth cut around its periphery
and the actuating worm engages in this wheel,
thereby obtaining a large reduction in speed. In
other words, the worm can be driven by a light,
high speed belt and pulley, and still revolve the
valve at a very low speed; such gearing is smooth,
silent running, and altogether admirable for such
a purpose as the one under consideration.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.—Fixed Discharger with Glass
Receiver.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>A very common form of separator, which is
used almost invariably on plants dealing with
wood shavings, sawdust and similar materials,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>is known as the cyclone or centrifugal separator.
This is usually constructed with a sheet steel body
with the inlet for the dust-laden air at the top,
and so arranged that the air enters tangentially.
Inside there is a smaller cylinder of sheet steel
forming an air outlet, and the laden air sweeps
round the annular space between the body and the
inner cylinder. This results in a whirling action
and the material entrained in the air is projected
by centrifugal force against the side of the separator
body. In some instances an internal ledge, or
plate of “corkscrew” form, leads the material
downwards towards the outlet at the bottom of
the separator.</p>

<p>In the case of some of the denser materials which
can be conveyed by air, it is sufficient to connect
the discharge pipe to an open bin or chamber, the
material in such cases being heavy enough to
separate itself by the action of gravity.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon S. Layton, describing dischargers in
his paper, before the Engineering Group of the
Society of Chemical Industry (Birmingham, April,
1920), stated—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are two types of dischargers in use:
The first consists of a large steel box divided
into two compartments. This box is arranged
to oscillate about a horizontal axis, so that each
compartment alternately is brought under the
lower opening of the receiver vessel.</p>

<p>“The other type of discharger consists of a
bucket wheel rotating continuously inside a
closely fitting casing. The material which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
being conveyed falls into the pockets of the
bucket wheel when these are on the top of their
revolution, and is passed out through an opening
in the lower side of the casing.</p>

<p>“It will be obvious that the working of both
types is liable to be interrupted by the jamming
of a foreign body (such as a piece of wood or a
bolt) in the working parts; in each case, special
mechanism for driving the discharger has been
devised, to avoid the interruption resulting from
such blocking, and to enable the discharger to
keep on working continuously.”</p>
</div>

<p>The rotary type of discharger is preferable to
the tipping box type, for the following reasons:
because the rotary discharger is more easily kept
air-tight, works without vibration, and gives a
practically continuous stream, whereas the discharge
from the tipping box occurs as large isolated
masses of material.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give specific details concerning
the discharger because, in all cases, the conditions
under which the plant has to work affect the whole
design. For instance, where the working is only
intermittent, e.g. the removal of ashes from a
boiler-house, the discharger can be eliminated,
provided that the ash bunker is large enough to
hold the quantity of ashes to be dealt with at
each operation. In such a case, the ash container
would be capable of being exhausted, and the
material entering as before would simply drop
by gravity into the container and remain there
until the pump was shut down; it would then be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
allowed to gravitate into the truck or other
conveyance for disposing of the ashes.</p>

<p>Hand-holes for cleaning, and easy access to the
interior are essential in the design of a discharger,
especially if the material to be handled is liable to
“pack” when entering at a high velocity.</p>


<p><b>Pipe Lines.</b> One of the most important points
in the designing of a pneumatic conveying system
is the correct lay-out of the pipe line.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p033" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p033.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.—Sturtevant Patent Junction.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>A fatal mistake often made in low pressure and
exhausting systems is that the numerous branch
pipes are added to or altered after the makers
have left the original installation. Almost invariably,
branches thus added are made to
approach the main trunk at too great an angle, with
the result that eddies and whirlpools are created
within the pipe, seriously reducing the output of
the main trunk. So essential is it that this junction
should be correct and that the two streams should
run as nearly parallel as possible, that the Sturtevant
Engineering Co. has patented a special
junction (Fig. <a href="#i_p033">9</a>) to bring together the two streams
of air in the main and the branch pipe practically
parallel, as shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>


<p><b>Bends.</b> In connection with high pressure systems,
the following points are of great importance.
All vertical and horizontal straight lengths may
be of a light section constructed in steel. Bends
should be avoided whenever possible, and those
which are inevitable should be made in hard cast
iron, with every possible provision for easy
replacement of wearing parts.</p>

<p>The wear takes place at the point of actual
contact which, in elbows, is practically confined
to one place only. The material rushes to the end,
strikes the bend, and—suddenly changing its
direction of travel—whirls off down the next
straight length. The impact and the resulting
wear on the pipe, as well as the breaking of the
material conveyed, are naturally much greater in
elbows than in easy bends, but if the breaking
of the material is not detrimental, elbows should
be employed, as they are less costly and can be
replaced more quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Certain raw materials—such as salt, soda, lime
and various chemicals—which have to be ground
before use, may be prepared to a considerable
extent for this operation by the use of elbows.
On the other hand, easy bends should be employed
for material which it is desired to convey without
damage, e.g. malt, coal, and granular substances,
which are finally required in granular form and
not as powder.</p>

<p>The wear in bends is only on the external
radius of the bend, and then is inclined to be
localized at certain points rather than distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
over the full sweep of the bend (see Fig. <a href="#i_p035-1">1</a>0);
this being so, it is often desirable so to construct
the bends that the back is in segments which can
be renewed easily (see Fig. <a href="#i_p035-2">11</a>). Alternatively,
the bend may be constructed on the “lobster”
principle (Fig. <a href="#i_p035-3">12</a>), only the worn sections being
replaced when overhauling. It is not necessary
always to take a bend at an angle of 90°, and if
the small short angle sections are interchangeable,
then almost any angle can be constructed by
building up with the necessary number of sections.</p>

<br>

<p>With regard to the straight lengths of pipe, it
is necessary to ensure a smooth internal bore,
especially at the joints. It is therefore desirable
that the joints should be self-aligning as, if this
is not the case, eddies will be formed which will
cause the material to deviate from the centre of
the pipe, striking the side at one or more definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
points where holes will eventually be worn through
the pipe.</p>

<p>In vertical pipes the evidence of wear is negligible,
in fact the conveyed material presumably
does not touch the pipe at all, but travels up the
centre of it as a core.</p>


<p><b>Capacity of Pipes.</b> The velocity of the air
passing up the pipe should be from 40 to 50 ft.
per sec., equivalent to about 35 miles per hour.</p>

<p>The conveying capacity of an efficient pipe line
is approximately 15 per cent. of the total capacity:
in other words, if the total cross-sectional area
of the pipe be taken as 100, the effective cross-sectional
area as regards conveying is 15.</p>


<p><b>Flexible Connections.</b> The flexible connections
attached to the permanent pipes may be ordinary
tubing, as made by the Flexible Metallic Co.
Phosphor bronze and other metals have been tried,
but the extra cost is not justified. A loose screw
collar connection makes possible easy fixing, and
permits the flexible connection to be removed
easily to prevent damage when not in use. Rubber
tubing, reinforced with steel wires, would be best
where it is important that the material conveyed
should not be damaged, but the wear on such
tubing is so rapid that the extra cost is not recovered
by the saving in damage to ordinary
materials. The length of the flexible pipe should
be such that the movement over the greatest
area to be covered does not put too great a strain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
on the bending properties of the tubing. On the
other hand, unnecessary increase in the length
of the flexible pipe merely increases the cost of
one of the shortest lived portions of the plant,
the “scrap value” of which is almost negligible.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Showing Three Positions of the Valve.<br>
<span class="smcap">Fig. 13.—King Full-way Junction Valve.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Valves, etc.</b> For use where branches are inserted
in the main pipe line for convenience in either
lifting over, or discharging over, a large area,
special appliances have been designed and these
should be used, as they do not create eddies or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
increase the pipe friction appreciably, or reduce
the carrying capacity of the pipe line. The King
patent full-way junction valve is an excellent
example, and is shown in Fig. 13, from which
it will be seen that a full bore circuit can be completed
in any of three directions. This valve has
no corners where the material can collect, hence
the pipes are sucked perfectly clean the moment
the feed is shut off.</p>

<p>Another convenient fitting of this description is
the Boby patent pipe switch. This device is
similar to a switch as used on a railway track,
and by its use three separate side positions may
be connected with one part on the main transport
line. When the switch is thrown over so as to
connect to any one particular branch, all other
branches are disconnected.</p>


<p><b>Telescopic Pipes.</b> When the unloading of ships
is carried out by “suction” it is necessary to
make provision for lengthening or shortening the
vertical suction pipe, or pipes (see <a href="#i_f004">Frontispiece</a>),
because the ship will rise as relieved of its cargo,
and the suction nozzle will simultaneously move
towards the bottom of the hold as the cargo is
discharged.</p>

<p>A still greater difficulty is encountered in tidal
rivers, where the rise and fall may be many feet and
must be allowed for continuously. This is best
done by the introduction of telescopic pipes in
the vertical downright pipes. These must be so
constructed that while it is fairly easy to increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
or decrease their length, the pipes must remain
air-tight at the joints and connections.</p>

<p>Where the rise and fall is small the difference in
level may be compensated by a ball and socket
joint, and a counter balance on the jib arm, but
this method has its limitations.</p>


<p><b>Pipes for High Pressure Systems.</b> Coming now
to the “small pipe,” high pressure systems as
used for vacuum cleaning plants, the pipe lines
must be designed and installed carefully and on a
liberal basis. It is mistaken policy to attempt
to economize by using a smaller main on branch
pipes. Small diameter pipes cause excessive
losses by friction, and naturally are less efficient
as regards power consumption.</p>

<p>The frictional losses in a system of this description
vary directly as the length of the pipe, and
inversely as the fifth power of the diameter.
Large pipes are therefore very desirable, not only
because of their greater carrying capacity—which
is very desirable—but also because such things
as matches, hairpins, etc., are picked up every
day by an installation as fitted in hotels, restaurants
and theatres. Such material quickly clogs small
pipes and causes endless trouble and delay.</p>

<p>The flexible hose should be as short as is consistent
with ease of working, because the frictional
losses in this class of tubing are very great. It
would be preferable to increase the number of
wall plugs, rather than have to use very long
lengths of flexible hose.</p>

Systems.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Suction Nozzles.</b> Probably more patents have
been taken out on new suction nozzles than on
any other portion of a pneumatic suction plant.
The chief desiderata for a nozzle on a <em>high pressure
system</em> for wheat, coal, ashes, etc., are that it
be of light construction to allow of easy manipulation
by the operator, and that it have some means
of allowing a “free air” inlet, making it impossible
to choke the nozzle by burying the end.
It is an advantage to be able to regulate the
free air inlet according to the conditions existing
with different materials. The same nozzle that
will act best while dealing with a large bulk of
material, may be quite unsuitable when it becomes
necessary to “clean up” in the corners of the hold
or waggon. Fig. 14 shows different types of nozzles
for high pressure plants, but as the efficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
and capacity of the plant can be affected
seriously by the design of this portion of the
apparatus, it is highly advisable to allow the
designer to have a free hand and to make use of
the experience already gained.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p041" style="max-width: 47.125em;">

Refuse from Double Tenoning Machine.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Nozzles designed for <em>low pressure systems</em>, dealing
with dust, shavings, etc., have to be built to suit
the machine to which they are attached, and they
therefore vary indefinitely in details of design and
construction. The same remarks apply to the
nozzles for use on suction cleaning plants. Figs.
15 and 16 show how the suction nozzles are adapted
to the machines.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p042" style="max-width: 46.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p042.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.—Sturtevant Equipment Removing Dust
from Sand-papering Machines.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>It must be remembered that in low pressure
systems handling shavings, dust, etc., the problem
is quite different from that in high pressure
systems handling wheat, etc. In the case of removing
dust or shavings from a machine, the
material is already in motion, and only requires
drawing forward and into the pipe system, but in
the case of conveyors for wheat, coal, etc., and in
the case of suction cleaners, the material to be
moved is heavy and stationary and has to be lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and started in motion before it can be carried
away. This necessitates a much higher air velocity
through the collecting nozzles.</p>


<p><b>Idle Nozzles should be Closed.</b> It is perhaps
advisable to draw attention at this point to the
disadvantages of using more than one suction
nozzle on one receiver at one and the same time.
The reader is asked to recall the fact that the
material is not lifted by vacuum, but that the
production of a partial vacuum causes a stream
of air to pass up the pipe at high velocity. The
material to be conveyed is entrained with the air,
and due to the frictional contact between the
particles of air and the particles of material, the
latter is lifted and carried forward.</p>

<p>If the conveying plant is to be efficient and of
reasonable capacity, the pipes must be relatively
large, and in order that the desired partial vacuum
may be maintained in them (establishing a vigorous
air current) without the use of an unduly large
pump, it is important that air be admitted only
through those nozzles which are actually in use.
Also, when more than one nozzle is in use at the
same time, it is necessary to keep each nozzle
covered with material to such an extent that the
same amount of air passes into each pipe. Unless
this is done a large quantity of air will pass up
one pipe, and a small quantity up the other, and
the amount of material taken in at each nozzle will
vary as the quantity of air varies. To consider an
extreme case, suppose that the man operating at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
one of the pipes allows his nozzle to become
exposed. Air will rush in at this nozzle to the full
capacity of the pump, with the result that little or
no air will pass up the second pipe, and consequently
no material either. Thus, if one man is
sufficiently neglectful to leave his nozzle idle and
open, he renders practically useless the other
nozzle or nozzles on the same main.</p>

<p>Even with care this is bound to occur to a certain
extent, as is shown by the figures given by makers
for the estimated power consumption, viz., about
1 h.p. per ton on single-nozzle plants, and 1½ h.p.
on double-nozzle plants.</p>

<p>Under these conditions it should be considered
whether it is more advisable to install one large
plant with two nozzles, or two small plants, each
with only one nozzle. The decision depends upon
the extra cost of power for the double-nozzle
plant compared with the higher capital charges
on the two single-nozzle plants.</p>

<span class="fs80">TYPICAL INSTALLATIONS FOR GRAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The pneumatic principle has been applied to the
handling of grain in bulk to a much greater extent
than to any other material. As previously stated,
the original successful plant invented and designed
by Mr. Frederic Duckham was for the handling
of wheat for the Millwall Docks Co., and the
success of this plant was such that it was imitated
by engineers in this country and abroad with
equally satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Grain lends itself admirably to pneumatic
transport because it is easy of flow, regular in
size, and practically self-feeding. Also, the removal
of dust, which is incidental to pneumatic
conveying, is a special advantage where grain is
concerned. Figs. 17 and 18 show clearly the
advantages of pneumatic conveying in point of
simplicity and labour saving.</p>


<p><b>Typical Quayside Plant.</b> Fig. 19 shows a typical
lay-out for a comparatively small plant handling
50 tons per hour. The diagram is almost self
explanatory.</p>

<br>

<p>This plant is simple, but every possible modification
can be added that circumstances make
desirable; such as discharging on to a belt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>conveyor, for feeding the silos or other storage
bins.</p>

<p>Where grain is bought by bulk it would be
necessary to check the weight, and in this case
an automatic weigher would be installed, into
which the material would be discharged from the
receiver. With a bag filter the collected dust can
also be weighed, the total weight being then
obtained by addition.</p>


<p><b>Typical Floating Plant.</b> The most popular
development of the above type of plant is the
floating plant, designed for erection on a hulk, or
barge, and intended to suck grain from an ocean-going
steamer and discharge it into barges or
lighters on the other side of the discharging plant,
as indicated in Fig. 20. The plant shown is one of
many in actual operation and its construction
may be followed by reference to the description of
the plant shown in Fig. 19, the same index letters
being used in each case. One great advantage
of floating plants is that the difference in height
due to tides is of no consequence.</p>


<p><b>Portable Plants.</b> Still another modification consists
of a complete quay-side plant mounted like
a travelling crane, so that it can be moved longitudinally
along steel rails on the quay-side. This
plant is particularly useful where large cargo ships
have to be emptied and then allowed to remain at
their berth until reloaded with another cargo.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p052" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.—Portable Railway Plant in Operation.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Complete plants have also been mounted on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>railway trucks, the engine and pump in this case
being on a second waggon (see Figs. <a href="#i_p050">21</a>, <a href="#i_p052">22</a>). In
such a case the plant has to be mounted very low,
and it is necessary to lift from the under-side of
the truck to, say, a railway waggon, by means of
an adjustable belt or bucket elevator (shown at
the extreme left of Fig. <a href="#i_p050">21</a>).</p>

<p>Many other applications will suggest themselves
to the reader, and sufficient has been said to prove
that for the handling of wheat the pneumatic
system is distinctly flexible and convenient; also,
it effects a great saving in labour, which is an
important consideration nowadays. “Bushelling,”
conveying, and weighing by hand used to
cost well over a shilling per ton, which figure was
reduced to just over 1½d. per ton by pneumatic
conveying; these are pre-war costs in both
instances, but the relative saving effected by
pneumatic conveying is certainly not less under
present conditions.</p>

<p>All the previous remarks also apply to linseed and
cotton seed in bulk, maize, oats, and in fact all
cereals. Such materials have to be accepted as
and when the ships arrive irrespective of convenience,
and it is an important advantage of
pneumatic conveying that the material can be
lifted and discharged in the most convenient
position; also, when the barge or ship has departed
the same apparatus can be utilized to lift the
material from its position in store to the cleaning
or grinding plant.</p>

<span class="fs80">PNEUMATIC COAL-HANDLING PLANTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The writer was directly interested in the erection
and installing of one of the first plants installed in
this country for the elevation and conveying of
coal, and a description of the various details may
give a good idea of a complete plant, handling
coal on a commercial scale.</p>

<p>The conditions to be complied with are as
follows: 20 tons of “slack” per hour, to be
raised 90 ft. above canal level or 80 ft. above
road level.</p>

<p>The coal is brought alongside the power-house by
canal barges of 25 tons capacity, or by tipping
steam waggons from the railway sidings, a distance
of one mile away. In both cases the coal is
required to be elevated into overhead bunkers
of 600 tons capacity placed vertically over the
boilers.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p055" style="max-width: 93.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p055.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.—Pneumatic Unloading of Coal at
Messrs. Boots, Ltd. (Nottingham).</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>In the first case, immediately the barge is alongside,
the flexible suction pipe is lowered into the
barge (Fig. <a href="#i_p055">23</a>), and coal immediately begins to
rise in the pipe and is discharged as required.
Little or no handling of the coal is required after
the suction nozzle has once reached the bottom
of the barge; all that it is necessary to do is to
bring the barge gradually up to the nozzle, the
coal then “avalanching” down to the nozzle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>Fig. 24 shows the discharger placed on girders
over the bunkers into which it discharges continuously.
The coal enters at <em>A</em> and the major
portion of the fuel is discharged through the
rotary valves <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>coal discharger</em> itself consists of a cast iron
vessel with two King’s patent rotating valves.
These are designed in the form of a slightly conical
taper divided into four sections, one portion of
the circular valve being under vacuum, and the
other under ordinary atmospheric pressure. The
outlet of the valves is larger than the inlet to allow
the coal which is in the valve to drop out easily.
Over each valve is also provided a four-armed
sweeper to prevent any damp coal from forming
a cone inside. The discharger is provided with
two inlets with full-way bored valves, so that the
coal can be drawn either from the water side or
from the land side at will. After the coal has been
deposited in the main discharger, there is provided
a supplementary discharger consisting of a vessel
6 ft. high by 30 ins. diameter, with two inlet pipes
of 8 ins. diameter, to provide a contra-flow, so
that any particles of coal dust in the air will
meet one another in the 30 ins. box at equal
velocity and be deposited. The small particles
are delivered by a supplementary rotary discharge
valve which is set to run very much slower than
the main discharger valves.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p057" style="max-width: 46.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p057.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.—Discharger for Coal Conveying
Plant.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The main discharger valves are driven by worm
gearing, the latter having one right-hand thread
and one left-hand thread, so that the end thrust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>on the worms is neutralized. Ball bearings are
provided and the small motor which drives all
three valves is coupled up with an electrical
device designed by the author. This device
ensures that if anything happens to the top discharge
valves—so that the 3 h.p. motor driving
them cuts out, owing to an overload or other
cause—then the main motor also is cut out by the
opening of its circuit breaker. This prevents any
“flooding” of the pipes and dischargers.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that the valves are so
designed that a portion of the weight of each valve
is carried by the vacuum, so that the vertical wearing
lift on the valves when at work is very slight.</p>

<p>The <em>intake pipes</em> for the coal are 5 ins. diameter,
and they are provided with heavy cast iron bends,
having extra thick metal on the outside radius
to allow for the wearing effect of coal passing at
the rate of 20 tons per hour.</p>

<p>The pipe into the barge is provided with a
flexible steel pipe at the suction nozzle end, for
convenience of handling. India-rubber piping has
been tried, but the extra cost does not justify
its continued use.</p>

<p>The nozzle is made as light as possible for convenience
of handling, and is fitted with a special
“free air” inlet for the regulation of the amount
of air necessary to blend with the coal.</p>


<p><b>Ash Handling.</b> In addition to unloading coal,
the above plant is capable of dealing with hot
ashes which are first crushed in a portable clinker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
breaker, electrically driven, which runs under all
the ash hoppers of the boilers. The ash when
crushed gravitates into funnel-topped tee-pieces,
inserted in the main ash-conveying pipe, whence
it is immediately sucked up into an overhead
ash hopper to await the convenience of the waggons
which dispose of it on the “tips.”</p>


<p><b>Flue Cleaning.</b> A 3 in. suction pipe has been
run round the boiler-house in such positions that
flexible hose can be attached for flue cleaning
purposes. In this case the cleaners simply use
an enlarged nozzle such as is supplied with a
domestic equipment and the dust is removed
from the flues, economizer soot chambers, etc.,
into the ash hopper without trouble or dust.</p>

<p>The success of this plant is best indicated by
the fact that, at the moment of writing, a duplicate
plant is being erected. Owing to the growth of
the business, and its demand for power and steam,
the original plant has to be worked continuously
on coal, so that the ash and flue dust problem has
become acute again.</p>


<p><b>Portable Floating Plant.</b> A third plant ordered
by the same firm is of considerable interest. This
is intended to be mounted in a barge so as to be
portable. Owing to lack of space in close proximity
to the power-house, considerable difficulty
is found in keeping adequate stocks of coal on
the site except the 600 tons in the overhead
bunkers. In order to secure continuity of working,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
it is essential that as much fuel as possible be
stored, and for this purpose a coal pile has been
made about half a mile away from the works,
adjoining the canal. Ashes can be disposed of on
certain fields a few miles outside the city in
swamps and pools caused by subsidences, due
to colliery workings.</p>

<p>The portable plant is therefore arranged to
operate as follows: the barge is self-propelled by
a 30 h.p. paraffin engine which can be coupled by
clutches to either the propeller or a Roots blower,
the latter being the exhauster for the portable
suction plant.</p>

<p>The barge is loaded with ashes for disposal,
and then proceeds under its own power to the site
where they are to be dumped. The clutch is
operated disconnecting the propeller and operating
the blower. The suction side of the blower is
coupled up with the pipe line in the boat and the
barge feeds the plant by means of the flexible
hose: the discharge pipe is raised over the towing
path so as not to interfere with passing traffic,
and the ashes are blown out into the swamps
previously mentioned. It will readily be recognized
how simple this unloading becomes compared
with trying to dig out the ashes with either a
spade or a fork.</p>

<p>The empty barge then returns to the coal pile
and takes up a load of coal in a similar manner,
then proceeding to the power-house under its own
power and being unloaded by the original fixed
pneumatic installation in the ordinary way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>The coal arriving by road is tipped into a
concrete hopper excavated below the ground level,
and so designed with sloping sides that it is self
feeding into a suction pipe connected to the bottom
of the hopper. The same procedure occurs except
that in this case the coal enters the main discharger
at the top (<em>E</em>, Fig. 24).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the very fine dust
collected from the air filter is eagerly sought after
by the foundry trade, and what would at first
appear to be a waste product impossible to burn,
is actually a valuable by-product of the plant.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">Numerous means have been devised to cause the
necessary current of air to flow along the conveyor
pipe, but the ideal method is probably yet to seek.
Probably the most satisfactory and economical
system, until recently, was the positive pump
exhausting a vacuum chamber; the latter receiving
the material, and discharging it into the
receptacle provided for that purpose.</p>

<p>The difficulties arising in practice, however,
incited the inventive genius of engineers responsible
for the operation of these plants, and a
number of attempts were made to induce an air
current by other means.</p>


<p><b>Ejector Systems.</b> Steam ejectors were fitted
to the closed tank provided for the reception of
the material, thus converting the tank into a
vacuum chamber, and eliminating the discharger.
In other cases injectors, also operated by steam,
were placed at intervals along the conveyor
pipe, usually at such convenient points as 90°
bends, and the slight vacuum created by the
condensation of the steam and also by the velocity
of the jet, induced an air current which swept
the material along with it into the receiver chamber.</p>

<p>Although both these methods are in practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
use, their applications are strictly limited to
materials which do not suffer by contact with
heat and moisture; the methods are therefore
used principally for conveying ashes and soot from
boiler furnaces and flues. Ashes formed by the
combustion of coal contain large amounts of
abrasive matter, and it is very important that all
this matter should be extracted from the air,
before entering the exhauster of the suction system.
The steam jet cuts out the exhauster entirely, but
absorbs an excessive amount of power in the form
of steam. It has the advantage, however, of
quenching the ashes on their way to the settling
tank. For flue dust, however, the steam jet is
unsuitable, as the condensed vapour causes the
material to cake in the pipes, and the latter
rapidly become choked, involving considerable
delay and trouble in cleaning out. The ejector
system is used for this material, the tank being
of the closed type, and the necessary vacuum
being created by a steam ejector fixed in a branch
at the side near the top, the dust striking a baffle
and falling by gravity to the bottom of the tank.
A special air-tight gate or valve is opened to empty
the tank.</p>


<p><b>Air Induction.</b> The cardinal feature of the
induction system is the ease with which materials
may be handled which cannot be conveyed by the
suction method.</p>

<p>Sand, sugar, salt, soda ash, and many other
substances of a granular nature, which are very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
troublesome when conveyed by the suction method,
may be dealt with economically by the induction
system and, although the latter is only in its
experimental stages at the moment of writing, it
is possible that it may displace all other systems
in the near future.</p>

<p>The induction system differs from the suction
system in that the air flow along the pipe is induced
by a jet of air, at very high velocity, fixed at any
convenient distance from the intake nozzle of
the conveyor pipe, and the material conveyed is
discharged either from an open end into an open
container, or by some form of cyclone. The closed
discharger or container, with its baffles and rotary
valves or air locks, is eliminated, and the substance
to be handled has a free and unrestricted flow
throughout the length of the pipe.</p>


<p><b>Advantages of the Induction System.</b> The
advantages of the induction conveyor may be
summarized as follows: (1) Low first cost, the
power unit being the only expensive item. (2) Low
maintenance cost, there being no moving parts and
little wear. (3) Low labour cost, practically no
attendance being required. (4) Flexibility and
ease of handling. (5) High efficiency of power
unit and reliability of system. (6) Ability to
handle materials which are easily damaged.</p>

<p>In the case of a suction plant handling grain or
coal, the intake end of the conveyor is fairly
flexible, and the nozzle may be operated over a
fairly large radius, say, all over the floor of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
vessel’s hold. The discharge end, however, is
fixed, unless a cumbersome and expensive gantry
is provided to permit of the discharge apparatus
being moved about. Even should the discharger
be mounted on rails, the area over which it can
operate is limited by the rails on which it runs.
With a large plant, this would mean that a number
of dischargers would be required to lift from a
ship into a warehouse or store, from the latter
into bunkers or silos, or perhaps into trucks or
waggons. Each discharger would require a separate
exhauster and a separate intake, and valuable
space would be occupied by the plant and expense
incurred for machinery which would not be in use
for a considerable part of the time.</p>

<p>The induction system, however, is flexible at
both intake and discharge ends of the pipe. It is
only necessary to lower the nozzle into the material
to be removed, and to place the delivery pipe over
the receptacle for the material, and to turn on the
air jet. The delivery may be handled easily while
working, and the material distributed where
required; or suitable valves and branches may be
fixed, and a number of discharge pipes used in
turn to deliver into different bins or into various
floors.</p>

<p>The source of power for the operation of the
induction conveyor is the air compressor. As every
operating engineer is well aware, all machinery is
kept in better condition and runs more economically,
when it is housed in proper environment and
receives skilled attention. The compressor, in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
case, need not be erected near the work, but may
be placed some distance away, preferably in the
power station, as the pipe line connecting the
conveyor with the machine will have a very small
bore, compared with the air pipe to the exhauster
on a suction plant, and will also be inexpensive to
erect and maintain. In the instance quoted
above, where a number of suction and delivery
points are required, only these small pipes need
be run from a common main, and turned on and
off as needed, the compressor running continuously
at or near its most economical load.</p>


<p><b>Construction of Induction Plant.</b> The induction
conveyor may be said to be a compromise between
the suction and blowing methods. The air jet
is fixed in the conveyor pipe at a suitable angle,
some distance above the intake nozzle, and a
stream of air at high velocity is passed along
the pipe in the direction of the discharge. This
air jet is designed carefully for the duty it has to
perform, and its discharge entrains the free air
in the pipe, causing it to move in the required
direction. A partial vacuum is created in the
conveyor pipe, behind the jet, and free air rushes
in at the intake, carrying the material along with
it.</p>

<p>In order to effect the greatest economy in the
operation of this plant, it is important that the
power unit should be carefully chosen, and that
the pipe system should be designed to give the
full pressure at the jet. With modern multiple-stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
compressors of the rotary or reciprocating
type, working at about full load, very high efficiencies
can be obtained, and the pressure pipe line
should be arranged to avoid loss by friction as
far as possible. The receiver should be of sufficient
capacity to absorb any pulsations, and to throw
down oil and moisture before the air enters the
pipes. A separator of good design should also be
incorporated.</p>

<p>In designing the conveyor pipe line, bends
should be avoided when possible, by erecting the
lifting pipes at an angle with the horizontal. It
is not sufficiently well appreciated that bends and
angles rapidly increase the frictional resistance
to the flow of the conveying medium, and mean
loss of power; in fact there is no doubt that the
difference between success and failure in pneumatic
conveying is largely a matter of design. Many
substances which are otherwise quite suitable for
handling in this manner are very fragile, and any
friction on pipe walls or contact with metal baffles
at high velocity, so reduces or pulverizes them
that their value is reduced considerably. In the
case of ashes from boiler furnaces, this effect is
advantageous rather than otherwise, but when
dealing with coal it is necessary to arrange the
system so that the minimum amount of damage
is done to the material. Some coals, such as
Derbyshire bituminous, is not easily broken or
abraded, and can be lifted very satisfactorily by
the usual suction method. Welsh coal, on the
other hand, is very friable, and if conveyed into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the usual discharger, will emerge in a finely divided
state, even though it may be fed to the intake in
large pieces. For handling such materials, the
induction method is most suitable, as the discharge
end may be arranged so that the material is not
delivered at high velocity, and does not strike
any obstacle which would reduce it or break it up.
It is possible to elevate potatoes and even oranges
by the induction process, and it is quite within
the bounds of probability that eggs may be
delivered in this manner, without more than the
usual percentage of breakages.</p>

<p>In conveying many materials, which are conveyed
whilst hot, it is better if they can be kept at
practically the same temperature at the delivery
as when they enter the pipe. This is provided
for by heating the air to a suitable temperature
just before it enters the jet.</p>

<p>This is also an additional source of economy in
operation. As is well known, air, like all other
gases, increases in volume with the temperature,
and if the heat lost by the air cooling after compression
be replaced at the jet, considerably more
power is obtained. If the compressor is situated
in such a position that most of the heat of compression
is delivered at the jet, there is little to be
gained by reheating. In most cases, however, the
air has returned to normal temperature by the
time it reaches the point where it is to be used, and,
if a suitable air heater is installed at this point,
the volume may be increased greatly by a
comparatively small expenditure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>A heater consisting of tubes through which the
air passes, these tubes surrounded by water under
high steam pressures, offers the most convenient
and satisfactory method of heating the air. The
air pipes between the heater and conveyor pipe
should be lagged in order to retain the heat.</p>

<p>The pressure of the air may be increased by
50 per cent. by heating to the temperature of
steam at 200 lbs. per sq. in. gauge pressure, while
the cost will be comparatively small. Theoretically,
a gain of about 40 per cent. in economy
should be obtained, and the practical results
should be reasonably close to this figure.</p>


<p><b>Air Receivers.</b> It is a decided advantage in
practice to install an efficient separator between the
ordinary receiver of the compressor and the pipe
line, as large quantities of moisture will travel
over with the air, and will be condensed directly
they meet some cooler surface. The ordinary
receiver is supposed to fulfil this function, but it
does not do so because it is, in effect, an enlargement
of the pipe line, and, being filled with hot
air under pressure, has no tendency to condense
the moisture. The latter does not begin to cool
to any extent until it reaches the small diameter
pipes, with the consequence that these pipes
contain quantities of oil and water which eventually
reach the jet, and are blown into the material
handled.</p>

<p>Where compressors of the rotary or turbine
type are installed, there will be only water in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
expansion, but it is good practice to remove this,
even though the air be re-heated, because the
moisture will recondense in the conveyor pipe,
and tend to choke the latter when small grained
substances are being conveyed.</p>


<p><b>Types of Compressors.</b> Reference has already
been made to the power unit, and it is hardly
within the scope of this work to describe in detail
the various machines available. As, however, the
economy of air conveying depends in a large
measure on the cost of power, it is evident that the
compressor should be of the most suitable type for
the duty to be performed.</p>

<p>For small installations, single-stage reciprocating
machines, driven directly by steam engines or by
electric motors are, no doubt, the most suitable.
In the case of large plants, using the air continuously
in a number of air jets, where the load
factor is high, it is certainly more important to
install a two or three-stage compressor, owing to
the greater economy of working. The larger
capital expenditure will be compensated by the
considerable saving of energy. As compared with
single-stage compression to 100 lbs. gauge pressure,
a saving of 20 per cent. can be effected by three-stage
working, and with a constant load of from
75 per cent. to 100 per cent. of full load, a turbine
or electrically driven rotary multiple-stage
compressor is decidedly the best type to adopt.</p>

<p>In plants where exhaust steam can be used to
advantage, as in large generating stations, a steam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
turbo-compressor, multiple-stage, exhausting to a
feed water heater will show great economy, and
the operating costs of a large plant of this type are
very low compared with any other form of conveyor.
This will be obvious when it is pointed out that
maintenance costs on the conveyor are confined
to renewals of bends and junctions in the pipe
lines, and of flexible hose. There are no discharge
valves or air locks to be kept vacuum tight, no
filter strainers or sleeves to renew, and the power
unit is not subjected to undue wear through
extraneous matter entering the cylinders and
scoring the walls or wearing the valves.</p>

<p>Compared with other forms of mechanical
conveying, the pneumatic induction system is
very low in maintenance costs, while the serious
charges incurred in employing human labour are
reduced to a minimum.</p>

<span class="fs80">STEAM JET CONVEYORS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">A method of removing ashes from boiler furnaces
which has been developed extensively in America
is essentially a pneumatic system, although steam
is the conveying medium instead of moving air.
Steam is used because the apparatus is always
in use on boiler plants, from which steam can be
taken as conveying medium. No air compressor
or other special plant is required. On the other
hand, the simple use of a connection from the
steam main is a matter of very little importance,
and no check is ever made as to the amount of
steam so used, hence 99 per cent. of the users
consider that the steam jet costs practically nothing
for “power” compared with a compressor which
would have a certain sized motor connected, and
could not escape attention as an additional power
consumer.</p>


<p><b>Steam Consumption.</b> Investigation into the
actual consumption of steam jets would often
give very startling results, especially after the
plant had been in operation for some time and the
nozzles had begun to cut and wear. As proof
of the waste of steam possible in such a plant,
it is interesting to note that Mr. David Brownlie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
in a paper on Automatic Stokers,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> gave results
of actual tests made on steam jets as used in
certain classes of stokers in which steam jets are
allowed to blow down the hollow furnace bars.
These tests showed that, whereas the makers
estimated the steam consumption of the jets to be
about 2 per cent. of the boiler output, the tests on
80 plants showed a consumption varying from
0·5 per cent. up to as much as 21·4 per cent. of the
total output of boiler.</p>

<p>As further evidence of the waste of steam that
can occur due to neglect of the cutting effect on
the nozzles, one American firm has designed an
ingenious warning or “tell-tale.” A small hole
is drilled almost, but not quite, through the nozzle.
While the nozzle retains its initial shape and size
the apparatus acts normally, but as soon as the
small amount of metal covering the end of the
hole has worn away, the hole is exposed, and a
certain amount of steam passes through it to a
steam whistle which blows continuously until a
new nozzle has been inserted in place of the one
which is now worn so much as to make it
uneconomical in steam consumption.</p>

<p>Provided that means are taken to prevent waste
of steam due to worn nozzles, the steam jet conveyor
is very serviceable and, being flexible and
convenient, it is very useful for the purpose for
which it has been developed.</p>

<p>The following estimated steam consumptions are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
given for what they are worth; they are of comparative
value in relation with the power consumption
on the “suction” scheme: One firm
claims, in an actual proposal for a plant to be
erected in this country, a consumption of 30 lbs. of
steam per min. to deal with 150 lbs. of ashes per
min., or 4 tons per hr. This is approximately
equivalent to 72 electrical h.p. for dealing with
4 tons of ashes per hr. A second firm states that
a steam jet plant dealing with 12 tons per hr. will
require 3,466 lbs. of steam per hr. at 130 lbs.
pressure: this, if passed into a modern steam
driven generator, would produce over 130 h.p.
hours. These figures indicate how variable are
the estimates of power required. <em>Note.</em>—The
“suction” schemes for wheat actually work out
at slightly more than 1 h.p. per ton per hr. in
single-nozzle plants, and 1½ h.p. per ton per hr.
in twin nozzle plants.</p>


<p><b>Lay-out of Plant.</b> The plant is usually designed
on the following lines: Immediately under the
ash hoppers are funnel-shaped tee-pieces fitted to
a cast iron pipe laid on the floor, or preferably in
a small trench just below the ground level. These
funnel inlets are usually covered with a cap when
not in use, a tight joint being established by the
“suction” in the pipe line. When used on
Lancashire boilers having no ash basement the
ashes are raked from under the furnaces on to the
floor, and swept into the inlets mentioned (see
Fig. 25). Large pieces of clinker are broken by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>hand until they enter the intake pipe, when they
are immediately conveyed through the rest of
the system.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p075" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p075.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.—Brady Steam Jet Ash Conveyor.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>In all large boiler houses with a proper ash
basement it is usual to have a travelling clinker
breaker, motor driven, which can be moved on
light rails under each ash hopper and over each
intake. The breaker receives all the ashes when
released by the hopper valve, crushes them
to a suitable size and discharges them by
gravity over the intake funnels, whence they are
transported to the ash tank or hopper.</p>

<p>The method of creating the moving air currents
is by passing steam through specially designed
nozzles which are placed at the extreme end of
the intake pipe, and force the air out of the pipe,
thus inducing a stream of air to enter at the intake
openings, and carry forward the ashes which have
been fed into the pipe with the air. When the
underground pipe has to rise vertically to cross
roads, etc., or to reach an overhead tank, it is
usually found necessary to insert “booster” jets
to impart additional velocity to the ashes, which
are naturally retarded seriously in changing their
direction at the bend or elbow. Should circumstances
necessitate many bends being employed in
the pipe line the number of “booster” jets has
to be increased, and the total cost of steam for
operation is increased seriously.</p>

<p>The capacity of the conveyor depends upon the
volume of air passed through the pipe in a given
time, and the ashes must not be slacked before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
handling, but must be handled either straight
from the furnaces or allowed to cool and then
conveyed to the ash hopper.</p>

<p>An 8 in. pipe is the largest used, and this will
handle approximately 8 tons of ash per hour. Any
increase over this size of pipe necessitates a
consumption of steam which makes the scheme
impracticable.</p>

<p>The conveyor pipe may be run at any angle,
elevation or level, and therefore is not handicapped
by the rigid straight line, point-to-point, requirements
of bucket elevators, skips, etc.</p>

<p>The abrasive action of ashes is well known, and
when they are travelling at the high speed necessary
with this form of conveyor they cause considerable
wear at the bends and elbows in the pipe line. To
overcome this a special mixture of iron has been
obtained, which is extremely hard and wear-resisting.
Steel is quite unsuitable and ordinary
cast iron is too soft for these conditions.</p>


<p><b>Steam Jets.</b> The James Brady Foundry Co.
(Chicago, U.S.A.) state, in their Bulletin on this
subject, that the special steam jet elbows are
usually placed at the top and bottom of a vertical
riser. The jet of steam from the nozzle enters
the elbow directly in front of, and parallel to, the
face of a special wearing liner. This prevents
or reduces the wear on the liners, as the jet protects
the liners from the pounding action of the ash.
A renewable sectional liner is provided of specially
hard metal at all points in which the material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
makes actual contact with the pipe or fittings.
These liners are interchangeable in all elbows, and
each individual liner can be turned end for end
when affected by wear.</p>

<p>In cases where the length of horizontal run
exceeds 125 ft. it is necessary to supplement the
primary nozzles by “booster” steam jets to
maintain the velocity of the air current.</p>


<p><b>Buffer Boxes.</b> At the discharge end of the pipe
line it is necessary to insert a baffle or buffer box to
take the impact of the ashes, and thus prevent
wear on certain parts that are not designed to
stand up to the destructive effects of the impact.
The function of the box is to bring the ashes to
rest, so that they may fall by gravity into the ash
tank or on to the storage pile. When delivering
into a tank it is very essential to install a buffer
box, as otherwise the velocity with which the
ashes enter the tank will pack them so tightly
that they will not discharge automatically through
the valve or gate. The location of the ash hopper
can be wherever most convenient for loading the
vans, railway trucks, or barges, etc., but preference
should be given to a site which makes possible a
pipe run with a minimum number of bends.</p>

<p>One American firm of engineers, the Vacuum
Ash and Soot Conveyor Co., New York, have done
away with the numerous steam jets and the blowing
effect produced thereby, and rely entirely on
suction by using a sealed ash tank and exhausting
the container and pipe system by means of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
single steam jet injector built into the roof of the
ash tank, and discharging its steam directly into
the air.</p>

<p>By this means it is claimed that the following
advantages are obtained: (1) No sand-blast effect,
such as is inevitable when blowing at high velocity.
(2) No steam enters the ash tank and consequently
there are no condensation troubles. (3) Much less
dust is blown into the atmosphere as the steam
is never in contact with the dust. (4) Conveyor
pipes are cleaner since no steam enters them, as
in “blowing,” and there is therefore no
condensation, caking and corrosion.</p>

<span class="fs80">MISCELLANEOUS APPLICATIONS OF PNEUMATIC
CONVEYING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><b>Pneumatic Despatch Tubes.</b> The ordinary pneumatic
conveyor picks up material at one point and
unloads it at another and continues this course
consistently, whereas the “pneumatic despatch
tube” is a conveyor of small articles enclosed in
a special cartridge which is built to fit the tube
and which travels to and fro as required, carrying
a variety of articles, or if necessary, the same
articles, backwards and forwards between the
same two stations or a series of fixed stations.</p>

<p>The despatch tube thus constitutes an effective
“mechanical messenger.” One or more tubes are
run between the points to be connected, with a
despatch and receiving terminal at each end, or
if necessary, a single line to operate in both
directions can be designed. The tubes vary from
1½ ins. to 4 ins. diameter, and they are also made
of oval sections up to 4 ins. × 7 ins.; rectangular
tubes have been installed in special installations,
chiefly in telephone exchanges for convenience
in dealing with certain cards there employed.</p>


<p><b>Tubes.</b> The tubes are of lead and are usually
encased for protection against mechanical damage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
and the erection is carried out with great care so
as to preserve the smooth interior. Joints occur
at intervals of 28 ft. or less, and are “wiped”
with an ordinary plumber’s joint over an internal
mandril which is heated previous to insertion
in the tube. Air-tight joints and smooth interiors
are absolutely essential to a successful installation.</p>


<p><b>Carriers.</b> The carriers or cartridges in which the
material to be transmitted is placed are made of
gutta-percha covered at the ends with felt. One
end of the container is closed and the other end
is left open, but a “skirt” of felt surrounds the
open end, and, as this is the “trailing” end and
the air pressure is behind it, the air forces open the
“skirt,” making a tight fit and preventing leakage
of air past the carrier. The nose of the carrier is
usually fitted with a felt “buffer” which also
assists in making an air-tight fit. A carrier for a
2½ in. tube is 6¾ ins. long and weighs empty about
3 ozs. Fig. 26 shows a large carrier.</p>


<p><b>Methods of Working.</b> Pneumatic tubes are
worked either by air above atmospheric pressure or
by reducing the pressure below atmospheric. In
the pressure system the usual pressure is about
10 lbs. per sq. in. above atmospheric pressure,
whilst in the suction system the vacuum employed
is equivalent to about 6½ lbs. per sq. in.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p082" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.—Typical Lamson Intercommunication Carrier.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Also, the method of working may be either
“continuous” or “intermittent”; in the first
system the air, either above or below atmospheric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>pressure, is circulating continuously and the cartridge
or carrier is inserted into a stream of air
already in circulation, whilst in the “intermittent”
system the power, either pressure or suction, is
admitted to the conveyor tube only after the
carrier has been inserted, and it is again cut off
when the carrier reaches the end of its journey.</p>

<p>To a great extent the success of a pneumatic
tube system is the speed at which it can transmit
the message sent by this means. In the “continuous”
system, working above atmospheric
pressure, the speed is not so great as in the
“intermittent” scheme, because the pressure in
the tube is the same in front of and behind the
carrier, which has to displace the air in front of it.
In the “intermittent” system the pressure is
turned on after the carrier is in place, and the
advancing carrier has only to move the air at
atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, if
suction is employed, the “intermittent” system
is slower than the “continuous” system because
the air has to be exhausted to a certain point
before the carrier begins to travel. It is true that
it will begin to move as soon as the difference in
pressure amounts to a few ounces, but there is a
distinct “time lag” compared with inserting
the cartridge into a tube continuously exhausted
when it starts off at practically full pressure and
speed immediately.</p>

<p>The difference in time is stated by Kemp to be
3 per cent. longer with “continuous” pressure,
compared with “intermittent” pressure at 6 lbs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
per sq. in.; the difference increasing to 6 per cent.
when the pressure is raised to 14 lbs. per sq. in.
The average working speed of these tubes is from
25 to 30 miles per hour.</p>


<p><b>Power Required for Operation.</b> It is difficult
to determine the actual amount of power necessary
to carry a cartridge through a tube. <cite>Kemp’s
Engineer’s Year Book</cite> states that, working at the
standard pressure of 10 lbs. per sq. in., the power
required is theoretically 3·35 h.p. for a 2½ in. tube,
1 mile long, but actual experience suggests that
at least 50 per cent. should be added to allow for
losses from various causes, making the actual
power, say, 5 h.p. per 2½ in. tube per mile.</p>

<p>Pressure receivers or tanks are inserted between
the pump and the travelling tube to compensate
for the impulses due to the irregularity of the
pumps and also to act as reservoirs furnishing
additional power during periods of abnormal
working.</p>

<p>The vacuum system takes less power (for a
definite time of transmission) than is required
by the pressure method of working, but local
conditions always influence results considerably,
and it is inadvisable to give any definite figure as
to the power required, without actual knowledge
of the system and conditions involved.</p>

<p>The air compressors are usually driven electrically,
but they can, of course, be operated by any
other prime mover such as oil, gas, or steam
engines. It is economical to combine the pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
and suction systems by arranging the air compressor
to draw air from the vacuum receiver
into the compressor cylinders whence it is returned
to the pressure line.</p>

<p>Automatic valves keep the pressures in the
pressure and vacuum sides of the system within
pre-determined limits. “Make up” air is admitted
by the automatic opening of an atmospheric
valve when the pressure side of the system is
low and the vacuum side high, so that the pump
is deprived of sufficient air to operate the system
efficiently. Should the conditions become reversed,
that is, a low vacuum and a high pressure, then
the pump is working against a high back pressure,
and this is reduced by the opening of an atmospheric
relief valve which remains open until the
vacuum is restored to normal pressure. This
system is preferable to and more economical than
the use of two separate pumping and exhausting
machines.</p>

<p>Elaborate and valuable tables of horse-power
required by compressors and of “transit times”
for distances up to 4,500 yds. with 1½ in., 2¼ in.,
and 3 in. tubes are given in <cite>Kemp’s Engineer’s
Year Book</cite>.</p>

<p>The Lamson Tube Co., Ltd., have brought what
was originally invented as a means of conveying
persons to a practical business accessory, capable
of saving a great amount of time by despatching
sketches, papers, small articles, money, etc., here,
there, and everywhere at the rate of 30 miles an
hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>The utility of these plants has long been recognised
by banking establishments, the General Post
Office, large stores, factories, newspaper publishing
offices, etc. (see Figs. <a href="#i_p087">27</a> and <a href="#i_p088">28</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to the conveyance of messages and
papers, they are frequently installed to convey
money and bills from the numerous departments
of a large store to the cashiers, thus saving time
and effecting economy in labour and floor space.
One cashier can attend to from 10 to 15 stations,
or in small establishments all the stations can be
centralized around the book-keeper.</p>

<p>The installation of a power-driven plant is not
essential, providing that the service required is
not too great. A foot power pneumatic service is
available and it is in use in many business
establishments. In this system the methods of
transportation are similar to those in a power
plant, but the tubes are brought to a special
cabinet 15 ins. square by 2 ft. 6 ins. high, in which
is mounted a foot-operated pump of patented
design without bellows or cords. The pump is
operated as and when the service is required, and
there is no loss of any description when the
apparatus is not in use.</p>


<p><b>Pneumatic Tubes for Heavy Articles.</b> It is
interesting to recall, especially in view of the
proposed use of pneumatically-propelled parcel-conveying
trains by the G.P.O. in London, the
proposal made by Mr. Medhurst, in 1810, when it
was suggested that a carriage somewhat similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>to the modern railway carriage should be moved
through a tunnel by pneumatic means. So long
ago as 1667, Denin Papin read before the Royal
Society a paper entitled “A Double Pneumatic
Pump,” and definite mention of despatch tubes
was made in this paper.</p>

<p>In 1840 a pneumatic railway was actually built
and worked between London and Croydon, and
in view of its success was followed by others
between Dalkey and Kingstown and between
Exeter and Plymouth. From this it will be seen
that transportation by pneumatic means is not
modern in its application, and was originally
intended for very large tubes and weights, but
modern development has been toward small tubes
and light weights.</p>


<p><b>The Vacuum Cleaner.</b> The pneumatic transporting
of material in the form of dust has been
brought to a very high state of perfection during
recent years and an enormous number of plants
is now in use, ranging from the hand-propelled
machine to very large stationary equipments.</p>

<p>Certain hand-propelled machines have been
constructed in such a way that the fan is directly
operated by gearing from the running wheels, and
after a few moments a very considerable speed is
attained and the suction of the fan is used for
lifting the dust from the surface over which the
apparatus is travelling.</p>

<p>Numerous designs of more powerful machines
actuated by hand bellows have been placed on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
market and these possess the advantage that they
are independent of the use of power; but it is not
altogether easy to operate a machine by one hand
and to manipulate the nozzle with the other.</p>

<p>Electrically driven machines of almost numberless
designs are available. These usually employ
a high speed fan of the single-stage type, but a
piston pump is embodied in some designs.</p>

<p>In the removal of dust the same principle
applies as in the conveying of heavier materials,
i.e. it is not so imperative to obtain a high vacuum
as it is to have a large volume of air moving at
high velocity, hence the multi-stage turbine
machine has distinct advantages as regards weight
of material moved and economy of power.</p>

<p>The multi-stage exhauster consists of turbine
wheels mounted on a single shaft, the air being
drawn into the first wheel, from this to the second
wheel and so on right through the machine, each
wheel increasing the suction on the intake end
according to the total number of wheels or stages.
This style of machine is procurable in either the
stationary or portable type, and in both it is made
in various sizes, the portable machines ranging
from <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span> h.p. up to ½ h.p. for domestic purposes, and
from 1½ to 3 h.p. on trucks for cleaning electrical
machinery, railway carriages, etc. Figs. 29 and
30 illustrate typical stationary and portable plants
respectively.</p>

<br>

<p>It is not generally recognized what enormous
amounts of dust and dirt may be extracted by
these machines. From one London hotel a ½ h.p.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>cleaner removed 166 lbs. of dust from the carpets of
the public rooms only. On a cleaning test in a
first class dining car on one of the English railways
25 lbs. of dust was removed from 38 sq. yds. of
carpet. A rug in front of a lift in a London
stores yielded 91 lbs. 1 oz. of dirt to a small
machine.</p>

<p>The stationary plants are usually installed in the
basements of large office buildings, theatres, hotels,
clubs, etc., and the whole building is piped suitably,
wall plugs or connectors being fitted to which the
staff make connection by flexible hose as and when
required. The free end of the flexible hose is
fitted with one or other of a series of special nozzles,
the latter being adapted to the varying requirements
of everything in the room from floor to
ceiling.</p>

<p>With the portable hand sets or even with the
larger truck type, the design is complete as a
working unit; the equipment is used as manufactured
and there is little or no chance for the
user to endanger the working efficiency of the
plant. In permanent plants, however, as installed
in hotels, etc., it is necessary that all points
previously mentioned regarding pipe lines, valves,
junctions, bends, etc., should be considered and
acted upon.</p>

<p>The pipe lines should be too large rather than
restricted in any way, the suction flexible should be
kept as short as possible, and if necessary extra
connections should be allowed rather than require
flexibles too long for use without “kinking.”</p>

<p><b>Cleaning by Air Blast.</b> By transferring the hose
from the suction side to the discharge, a suction
cleaner may be used to blow dust from machinery
of all kinds and from places that are high up and
cannot be cleaned economically by suction. For
cleaning electric generators and motors by blast,
these machines have many advantages, and on
account of the large volume of air handled they
are much to be preferred to the small-volume
high pressure jet of the ordinary air compressor
often used for this purpose. With the portable
turbo-blower there is no danger of damage to the
insulation through high pressure, or through the
carrying of moisture and oil into the windings
with the air jet.</p>


<p><b>Pumping by Compressed Air.</b> Although, generally
speaking, the raising of water by compressed
air is not an economical method, it is frequently
adopted in mining and tunnelling where the use
of steam or electricity is objectionable. In these
cases, cost of operation is a minor factor, and it
may be interesting to give a few particulars of
this form of pneumatic conveying.</p>

<p>The simplest form of compressed air pump
consists of a closed chamber or tank immersed
in the water, to be raised or fixed at such a level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
that the water will flow into the tank. An air
pipe is connected to the top of the chamber, and
the rising main is carried inside the tank to the
bottom. On opening the air valve, pressure is
exerted on the surface of the water in the tank,
and the water is expelled through the lift pipe or
rising main. On closing the air valve, water
again fills up the tank, and the process is
repeated.</p>

<p>A decided improvement on this pump is the
return air pump, which consists of two closed
chambers connected through valves with the
rising main. The compressed air pipe passes
through a two-way valve, either into one tank or
the other, this valve being positively operated.
The method of working is similar to that of the
single acting pump, considering each chamber
separately, but one tank is filling while the other
is being emptied.</p>

<p>The air expelled from the filling tank, instead
of being discharged to atmosphere, and part of its
expansive power lost, is carried back through the
pipe, which would be the air intake pipe when
discharging, through a port in the two-way valve,
and into the compressor intake pipe. The air
leaving the filling tank is naturally above atmospheric
pressure, and assists the piston on entering
the compressor, thus reducing the power absorbed
in driving the latter.</p>


<p><b>Air-lift Pumping.</b> The air-lift pump is a
common means of conveying by pneumatic means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
and should not be confused with the above methods
of raising water by compressed air.</p>

<p>In the air-lift method of pumping air under
pressure is admitted at the foot of a pipe already
submerged in the well. The air does not merely
bubble through the water, as might be supposed,
but passes up the pipe as a mixture of air and
water. The introduction of the air into the rising
column of water makes the latter as a whole less
dense than the water around the tube, and therefore
we have a difference in head between the
internal and external columns of water which will
carry the internal column considerably higher than
the external column.</p>

<p>As the lifting force depends upon the “head”
of water outside the rising main, it follows that the
maximum height to which the water can be raised
depends upon the depth to which the air pipe
and rising main are submerged below the standing
level of the water in the bore-hole. In other
words, the greater the lift, the greater the depth
to which the air pipe must be carried before
releasing the air into the rising main.</p>

<p>Experience shows that the water pipe should be
submerged 18 ins. for every 1 ft. lift above the
water level in the bore-hole, and allowance must
be made for the “depression” of the water
level in the bore-hole, which will probably take
place when pumping is in progress. This depression
will vary according to the water bearing
capacity of the strata, in which the hole has been
bored, hence it is necessary to go carefully into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
the conditions before boring the hole. If available,
data should be studied concerning the standing
water level, and the pumping depression in other
bore-holes in the immediate neighbourhood. Also
tests should be made before the boring machinery
is removed because, although the initial depth of
bore-hole may be satisfactory on the basis of
standing level calculations, it may be found that
when pumping the depression is so great that
the bore-hole has to be carried to a greater
depth.</p>

<p>The air is supplied at a pressure suitable for the
conditions, and can be carried down a separate
tube and connected to the rising main at the correct
depth (Fig. <a href="#i_p098-1">33</a>), or, as is often done, one pipe may
be lowered and the rising main supported centrally
inside the casing tube, the annular space between
the two being used as the air pipe (see Fig. <a href="#i_p098-2">34</a>).</p>

<p>The amount of free air required is from 0·6 to
1·0 cu. ft. per gallon of water raised per min.,
provided that all the details have been studied
carefully and the design of the plant worked out
accordingly.</p>

<p>If the air pipe is too small the air will bubble
slowly through the water, while if it is too large it
will blow out with great force, spraying and
losing the water: the ratio between the cross-sectional
area of the air and water pipes is about
1½ to 4.</p>

<p>Advantages of air-lift pumping are that a greater
amount of water can be obtained from a hole of
given size than by ordinary pumping; and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>one compressing plant can deal with several wells
instead of needing a separate pump to each well.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Air-lift Pumping</span></p>
<br>

<p>The disadvantages are, that the mechanical
efficiency is low; that a considerable amount of
air is entrained in the water, and aerated water
is very unsuitable for boiler feed purposes; and
that means must be provided to allow air to
escape by passing the discharge from the pump
over a weir or similar contrivance. It is necessary
to have some reliable form of oil trap between the
compressor and the well to prevent contamination
of the water by oil carried over by the air from the
cylinders of the compressor; this is difficult,
because the oil is not only “atomized” but is
actually vaporized while in the compressor cylinders
and as a gas it is difficult to reclaim. The
air must be kept as low in temperature as possible,
and it is usually passed through a cooler before
being delivered down the well.</p>

<p>At times, air-lifts are installed for conveying
other liquids to a height, and when these can be
treated at a high temperature it is advisable, as
the efficiency is then much improved. Even under
these conditions it is advisable to cool the air to
the lowest feasible temperature, before using it
as a lifting medium.</p>

<p>When starting up, the column of water in the
rising main has to be moved as a solid column,
and consequently a higher pressure of air is required
at starting than when the column has been set
in motion, as the water and air then pass up in
alternative “pellets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>In chemical works and allied industries this
pneumatic method is frequently used for pumping
acids, and other corrosive liquids from one place
to another. Compressed air is a very handy
medium for this class of work as ordinary mechanical
methods are ruled out, due to the impossibility
of introducing corrosive liquids into the pumps and
syphons unless great expense is incurred by the
use of acid-proof materials.</p>

<p>The air-lift is also very advantageous for pumping
water which contains a large amount of sand or
similar gritty material which would cut and score
the walls of an ordinary piston pump. Air-lift
pumping is frequently used, therefore, on new
bore-holes until the sand, etc., has been eliminated,
after which the final pump can be installed without
fear of damage.</p>

<p>The question of submergence will frequently
make it impossible to use air-lift without boring
many feet deeper than would otherwise be
necessary, but when the water bearing strata
is low this form of pumping is frequently very
convenient.</p>


<p><b>Miscellaneous Applications of Pneumatic
Conveying.</b> Several other interesting applications
of pneumatic conveying may be enumerated but,
being somewhat outside the primary scope of this
book, they will not be discussed in detail. The
main object of the author is to raise interest in
the handling of solid materials in a manner
practically unknown to the general reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>The housing problem has developed the <em>pneumatic
handling of cement</em> in a liquid form, and houses
are now being built of reinforced cement in the
following manner. An expanded steel frame is
supported between concrete or brick piers, and on
wood sheeting where necessary, and liquid cement
is blown on to the metal in the form of a liquid
spray: the first coat dries quickly and leaves a
certain amount of cement covering the framework.
Then follows another coat, and again another and
so on, until the whole of the framework has been
covered to an appreciable thickness. The result
is a thin wall or slab of cement reinforced with the
steel and of great combined strength. Slightly
domed roofs constructed in this manner have
proved very strong and durable.</p>

<p>The <em>Aerograph</em> is an instrument working on the
same principle for the application of paint, and
it is used a great deal in the art world, in the
manufacture of Christmas cards, in panel painting,
and in interior decoration generally. Excellent
“tones” and shades are obtained by the simple
method of varying the thickness of the colour or
the number of coats applied. It is usual to convey
the surplus colour and fumes away from the
operator by means of a stream of air through a
special hood placed at the back of the work, thus
maintaining clean pure air for the operator.</p>

<p>A similar machine of more crude design is used
for whitewashing walls of stables, cattle pens, etc.
All these plants comprise an air compressor,
either power or hand operated, from which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
air is led to a special injector which draws up
through a second pipe a certain amount of the
material to be sprayed. The paint or other
material is then atomized and impelled with
considerable force on to the surface to be covered.</p>

<p>The <em>sand blast</em> is another application of pneumatic
conveying in which the medium conveyed
is sand, which has well-known cutting and erosive
effects when it impinges on a surface at high
velocity. This plant is used for decorating glassware,
obscuring sheet glass, and also for cleaning
stone buildings by the actual removal of the face
of the previously discoloured stone.</p>

<p>The <em>pneumatic conveyance of energy</em> is exemplified
by rock drills, riveting machines, coal-cutters and
innumerable other portable tools. Energy is
expended in compressing air which is transmitted
through pipes and made to yield its stored energy
by driving the air motors of the tools or other
apparatus in question.</p>


<p><b>Conclusion.</b> Enough has been said to show that
pneumatic conveying has made great progress, and
that the possibilities of this method of dealing
with the moving of solid materials are much
greater than has been generally recognized.</p>

<p>Almost anything that will enter a pipe up to
about 9 ins. diameter can be conveyed in this way,
either by “blowing” or “suction” or by the
“induction” method.</p>

<p>Weight and size is an advantage rather than
otherwise, and bricks can be dealt with more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
successfully than flour. The writer’s experience,
in the results of actual working with pneumatic
conveying, indicates that no problem should be
considered too difficult to be tackled by this
method, and that even the most unlikely materials
can be conveyed successfully by pneumatic means.</p>
